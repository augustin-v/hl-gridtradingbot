# (WIP)
## Grid trading bot from cli on hyperliquid
Still needs asset id logic implementation. See here: https://hyperliquid.gitbook.io/hyperliquid-docs/for-developers/api/asset-ids. 
I use examples from the  hyperliquid Rust sdk for reference https://github.com/hyperliquid-dex/hyperliquid-rust-sdk

You can launch the interactive CLI for settings with just this after cloning it(only runs on testnet for now):
```
cargo run
```
